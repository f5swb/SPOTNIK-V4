UARTs and Device Tree
Various UART Device Tree Overlay definitions can be found in the kernel github tree. The two most useful overlays are disable-bt and miniuart-bt.
disable-bt disables the Bluetooth device and restores UART0/ttyAMA0 to GPIOs 14 and 15. It is also necessary to disable the system service that initialises the modem so it doesn't use the UART: sudo systemctl disable hciuart.
miniuart-bt switches the Raspberry Pi 3 and Raspberry Pi Zero W Bluetooth function to use the mini UART (ttyS0), and restores UART0/ttyAMA0 to GPIOs 14 and 15. Note that this may reduce the maximum usable baudrate (see mini UART limitations below). It is also necessary to edit /lib/systemd/system/hciuart.service and replace ttyAMA0 with ttyS0, unless you have a system with udev rules that create /dev/serial0 and /dev/serial1. In this case, use /dev/serial1 instead because it will always be correct. If cmdline.txt uses the alias serial0 to refer to the user-accessible port, the firmware will replace it with the appropriate port whether or not this overlay is used.
There are other UART-specific overlays in the folder. Refer to /boot/overlays/README for details on Device Tree Overlays, or run dtoverlay -h overlay-name for descriptions and usage information.
For full instructions on how to use Device Tree Overlays see this page. In brief, add a line to the config.txt file to enable Device Tree Overlays. Note that the -overlay.dts part of the filename is removed.
